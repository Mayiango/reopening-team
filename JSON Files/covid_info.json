        "entry_and_exit_requirements": "   Per the latest Argentine government policy, any foreigner who is not a resident in Argentina will not be permitted to enter Argentina; the U.S. Embassy is not aware of an estimated end date for such travel ban. Multiple countries in the region are implementing travel restrictions with little advance notice. To stay informed of the latest travel restriction, visit the U.S. Embassy COVID-19 webpage for the country of your intended destination or stopover. Some countries in the region continue to allow U.S. Citizens to transit airside with onward travel to the United States. Travelers must confirm with their carrier their ability to transit. Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice from national, provincial, and local governments.  If You Have Decided To Remain in Argentina U.S. citizens sheltering-in-place should be prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period. For the provision of medical care, food, shelter, or other needs, you will need to rely on the Argentine system. The Government of Argentina has ordered a countrywide mandatory quarantine.  The quarantine has been extended through July 17, with an additional tightening of restrictions in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area.  Restrictions may vary by province; check with local provincial authorities for a complete list of guidelines.  Please note:  Plan to limit your movements in accordance with the quarantine, whether in the City of Buenos Aires or the provinces. Limited exemptions include movement to obtain food and medical care and travel to the international airport for ticketed passengers only. Additional information about quarantine exemptions can be found at https://www.argentina.gob.ar/coronavirus/aislamiento/exceptuados.(In Spanish)  If you have been using a Certificado Unico Habilitante de Circulacion, note that many previously issued Certificado Unico Habilitante de Circulación were invalidated by the latest quarantine extension; check with Argentine authorities to determine if you must reapply. Face masks or coverings must be worn in most public areas and in transport and cars. Transport remains extremely restricted.  The Ministry of Transportation halted all Argentine intercity domestic buses, trains, and flights in March, and most of these services remain suspended due to the ongoing quarantine order.  In the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, passengers can only board public transportation if there is an available seat (standing room passengers are forbidden). These regulations are likely to remain in place for the duration of the quarantine order. Travelers should expect further travel disruptions with little notice.  Additional information for U.S. citizens remaining in Argentina:  The U.S. government has begun processing economic impact payments for qualified recipients. The U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires will not receive or administer any of these funds on behalf of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. If you believe you are eligible to receive an economic impact payment, we ask that you visit the IRS Coronavirus webpage. U.S. citizens may be able to receive money from friends or family through Western Union’s affiliate in Argentina, Correo Argentino.

The document requested compliance by the population with COVID-19 prevention measures in place, as well as with subsequent progressive prevention measures not yet implemented.  In addition, the document issues a warning for the international community not to take additional measures on top of what the GoB has already done, citing the temporary closures of the Belgian School (l’Ecole Belge) and French School (l’Ecole Française de Bujumbura) as “unilateral, extreme, hasty measures.” On Saturday, March 21, the Ministry of Transport, Public Works, Equipment and Homeland Planning announced that all international commercial flights departing or arriving from the Melchior Ndadaye International Airport would be suspended for seven days.

        "country_specific_information": ":   Canada has confirmed cases of COVID-19 within its borders. On June 8 the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) announced modified entry restrictions for certain immediate family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residents. Read CBSA’s full announcement here. On June 16, the United States and Canada announced  a mutual agreement to extend restrictions on non-essential travel across our shared border for an additional 30 days.  “Non-essential” travel includes travel that is considered tourism or recreational in nature. “Essential travel” still permitted includes: work and study, critical infrastructure support, economic services and supply chains, health, immediate medical care, and safety and security. U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and individuals with valid travel documents will be exempted. Trade and business travel will continue to operate across our borders, ensuring workers and goods are not impeded.   Land borders are operating at reduced capacity and with limited hours. Visit CBP and CBSA for details on land border crossings. Travellers entering Canada must present a credible 14-day quarantine plan. Information on what constitutes a credible quarantine plan is available on the Public Health Agency of Canada’s website here. In addition to restrictions on non-essential travel between the United States and Canada, a number of provinces and territories have put in place specific restrictions for travel across their borders, including for domestic travelers. Please see our latest Message to U.S. Citizens on Domestic Travel Restrictions within Canada for more information. All passengers on flights departing or arriving at Canadian airports are now required to wear a non-medical mask or face covering that covers their mouth and nose. Please check the Canadian Government’s COVID-19 travel restrictions and exemptions page for additional information.  Note: Canadian authorities continue to ask the public to reserve medical masks for healthcare workers and first responders.   On April 5, 2020, Transport Canada issued measures limiting access to all Canadian waters by “passenger vessels” carrying more than 12 passengers “engaged in activities of an optional or discretionary nature”, including tourism and recreation (e.g. short-term cruises, tour boats and sight-seeing vessels) The new regulations also prevent any Canadian cruise ship from mooring, navigating, or transiting in Canadian Arctic waters (including Nunatsiavut, Nunavik and the Labrador Coast). Please see the full announcement at Transport Canada by clicking here. On March 28, the Government of Canada issued new domestic transportation measures designed to mitigate the risk of further spreading COVID-19 within Canada. These initiatives impact both air and rail travel. See Transport Canada’s COVID-19 website for information about COVID-19 measures and guidance issued by Transport Canada.

EU passport holders are allowed entry, including permanent residents of Schengen countries, plus Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, Romania, Switzerland, Ireland and the UK.

Exceptions to the travel ban include spouses or minor children of EU/Schengen nationals, long-term residents, members of government delegations and passengers in transit.

        "country_specific_information": "  Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza: Israel: Israel has confirmed cases of COVID-19 within its borders. The Government of Israel announced updated guidelines and restrictions regarding personal movements and social distancing to reduce the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). These guidelines include the requirement to wear a protective mask that covers the nose and mouth in public (see Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) guidance and/or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) instructional video) and guidelines regarding personal movement, gatherings, transportation, and businesses (see MOH guidance). U.S. citizens who wish to travel to the United States should arrange for immediate departure to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain in Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza for an indefinite period. The U.S. government has no plans to arrange repatriation flights in Israel at this time. United and Delta airlines currently offer regularly scheduled direct flights between Ben Gurion airport and multiple destinations in the United States, but flights are subject to change at any time. Effective July 1, El Al airlines has suspended all flights. Flights from Ben Gurion airport to other destinations which provide direct connections to the United States are also available. Further flight cancellations and suspensions can occur with little or no warning, making availability limited and unpredictable. Your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite timeframe. The Embassy is not able to assist with arranging commercial travel options. If your travel has been disrupted or to make travel arrangements, please contact your airline: United Airlines (Local: 03-5116787, U.S.: 1-800-225-8610), El Al Airlines (Local: 03-977-1111) or Delta Airlines (Local: 03-513-8000, U.S.: 1-800-221-1212) The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Warning Level 3 – Avoid Nonessential Travel to Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.

Entry/ Quarantine Requirements and Information On March 18, the Government of Israel announced that foreigners, including U.S. citizens, who are not Israeli citizens or permanent residents will not be allowed to enter Israel. Exceptions may be made for non-nationals whose lives are based in Israel. Such individuals who wish to travel to Israel should contact the Consular Department of the closest Israeli embassy or consulate for further information. We recommend travelers not board flights to Israel without a pre-clearance letter from the Israeli Government as there is no assurance they will be admitted into the country. Please note that all arriving passengers, including U.S. citizens, may be subject to health screening and/or a mandatory 14-day quarantine in a Government of Israel-established quarantine center. Those who demonstrate the ability to maintain proper home isolation (such as those with a housing of their own or a completely separate housing unit with no other occupants) may be allowed to undergo their 14-day required isolation at home or another suitable location available to them. Individuals who are unable to home-isolate according to regulations will be directed to hotel isolation at the expense of the State of Israel. Arriving passengers will not be allowed to return to home isolation via public transportation with the exception of taxis (in accordance with regulations on masks/open windows). For more information, contact the Israeli Ministry of Health. U.S. citizens who possess an Israeli visa (e.g., student visa) are encouraged to contact your local Israeli embassy or consulate to determine if you will be permitted entry prior to arrival.

The U.S. Embassy cannot predict when the airport may open or what the quarantine policy will be for travelers arriving in Jordan in the future. On June 4, 2020, the Government of Jordan announced the launch of a website which provides updates and FAQs about the COVID-19 situation in Jordan and explains the re-opening of the country’s various sectors.  Information on this website is available in English.  At the present time, social gatherings may include up to 20 people with social distancing and people may move outside the home from between 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 midnight every day.

Statistics in key areas (new infections, deaths, hospitalizations, and corona-related ICU admissions) have continued a downward trend since the June 1 relaxation of social distancing measures.  Weekly updates to the number of infections are being tracked on the RIVM website: https://www.rivm.nl/en/news/current-information-about-novel-coronavirus-covid-19 The Municipal Health Service (GGD) of the Netherlands and the Dutch National Institute for Public Health (RIVM) put the following protocol into action when a new COVID-19 infection is identified: isolation, contact investigation, and monitoring of the patient. People identified as contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 patient must monitor their health, check their temperature twice a day, and report to the GGD. RIVM is monitoring the situation with international partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Center for Disease Protection and Control (ECDC). In the Netherlands, general practitioners, infectious disease specialists, Municipal Health Services (GGD), and microbiological laboratories work together to test for and combat COVID-19. Anyone experiencing symptoms consistent with a possible coronavirus infection, including loss of smell and taste, may call the national hotline and schedule an appointment to be tested by the GGD. Please call 0800-1202 to schedule an appointment.  Please note that this test is only to establish whether you currently have the corona virus, not whether you may have had it previously.  For more information please see: https://www.rivm.nl/en/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/testing-for-covid-19 The Dutch government implemented measures to combat COVID-19:  Contact professions (i.e. barbers, hairdressers, nail salons, opticians, etc.) have resumed providing services.  Services are by appointment only and customers are required to demonstrate they do not have COVID-19 symptoms.  Libraries may re-open and non-contact sports such as golf and tennis may resume, but competitions are not be allowed. Sports and recreational activities have resumed as long as 1.5- meter social distancing restrictions are maintained. Primary and secondary schools have reopened. Cinemas, restaurants, cafes, and museums are allowed to re-open.  Reservations are required, with a 100-person maximum occupancy limit, excluding staff. Nightclubs remain closed until September 1. All campgrounds and vacation parks, cinemas, restaurants, cafes, gyms, saunas, casinos, sports/dance schools, and museums may re-open and the maximum occupancy limit indoors is 100.

Up to 250 people (excluding staff) may be in the same space outdoors but must maintain 1.5-meter distance, complete a health questionnaire, make a reservation, and have their own seat.  Zoos and amusement parks are exempt from visitor occupancy limits. Non-surgical face masks are mandatory on public transport including trains, trams, buses, taxis, and passenger vans.  An advance reservation and responding to a health questionnaire are required for taxis and passenger vans.  On all other types of transport (such as canal/river boats) passengers must maintain 1.5-meter distance. The Dutch government encourages everyone to continue to maintain 1.5 meters distance, wash hands often, avoid crowds, work from home as much as possible, and stay home if experiencing fever or other symptoms. The 1.5-meter rule does not apply to health workers, caretakers, hairdressers, masseuses, driving instructors, athletes, actors, dancers, people who live together, children aged 12 and under, and teenagers aged 17 and under when interacting with other teenagers and children.

Frequently Asked Questions: Question – Will the Department of State or U.S. military be evacuating U.S. citizens?  Answer – There are currently no plans to evacuate U.S. citizens from Norway. We are aware the governments of some other countries have announced suspension of air travel.  In those countries, the State Department is considering all options to assist U.S. citizens.  U.S. citizens should monitor our travel.state.gov website and enroll in STEP.state.gov for the most up-to-date information.  Question – Are Norway’s airports closed?  Am I stranded in Norway?  Answer – The Government of Norway issued a March 15 press release to clarify that it has implemented stricter border controls, but airports are not closed completely.  Flights continue for the moment so Norwegian citizens and residents abroad may return and residents of other countries and foreign tourists may depart Norway.  However, airlines have cancelled many international flights and availability of flights and routes is unpredictable.  Question – I am a U.S. citizen trying to fly home to Norway or the United States but cannot find a flight.  What are your recommendations?  Answer – Many travelers are having trouble finding flights due to route suspensions and widespread flight cancellations, but flights continue between many U.S. cities and transit hubs such as Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and Doha with flight connections to Norway.  Please continue to work with your airline and explore travel with other airlines that may still be offering flights to your destination.  Question – Do I need to wear a face mask during a flight to/from Norway?  Answer – Several airlines now require passengers to bring and use their own face masks and may deny boarding to those who do not do so.  If you plan on traveling, we advise that you consult with your airline about their specific requirements.  Question – Are healthy quarantined U.S. citizens allowed to leave Norway?  Answer – Yes, the Norwegian government is allowing symptom-free people in quarantine to leave Norway provided sound infection control measures are in place during transport from the place of quarantine to the place of departure.  For more information, please see the Norwegian government’s March 17 update for foreign nationals.  Question – Is there a quarantine for passengers upon arrival in the United States?  Answer – We refer you to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services for questions regarding medical screening and quarantine for U.S. citizens entering the United States from other countries and jurisdictions.  The Department of Homeland Security fact sheet on arrival restrictions indicates that passengers from designated COVID-19 affected countries will be required to arrive at one of 13 airports where the U.S. Government has implemented enhanced screening procedures and will be subject to a 14-day self-quarantine period.  Question – Is there a quarantine for passengers upon arrival in Norway?  Answer – Yes, currently for passengers who have traveled abroad within the past 14 days or for those that appear to have COVID-19 symptoms.  For more information about travel to and quarantine in Norway, see the following Quarantine Information from Helse Norge.  Question – What will happen if I overstay my visa in Norway due to quarantine or cancelled flights?  Answer – The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration has jurisdiction over residency and length of stay in Norway.  A March 20 statement from UDI notes that foreign nationals who are not able to depart Norway before their visa or residency permit expires will not face negative consequences.  UDI’s Question and Answer page further explains that it is not possible to apply for an extension with the police closed and that you do not need to contact UDI, but that you should try to depart Norway as soon as possible.

        "country_specific_information": ": The Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) has confirmed COVID-19 within its borders. General Conditions, Entry, and Exit: The country is currently under a State of Emergency (SOE), during which national and provincial governments have enacted various measures to prevent the importation and spread of COVID-19.  You may find more information about the country’s COVID-19 response and about measures put in place at https://covid19.info.gov.pg/. All inbound passengers must have an appropriate visa or entry permit and must also secure explicit approval from, and follow all instructions provided by, the SOE Controller.  U.S. citizens who wish to enter the country should complete the atwrite to covid19-admin.logistics@police.gov.pg to request instructions and approval, as appropriate.  All approved incoming passengers also need to complete an Air Passenger Travel Form to present to the airline at the time of check in. Air Niugini is currently the only airline operating international service to and from PNG.  It continues to operate a reduced schedule of international flights for inbound and outbound passengers between Port Moresby and Brisbane and Cairns, Australia, though there are few viable options for onward international travel to the United States. Air Niugini also operates regular flights to and from Singapore.  However, despite media reports that the Changi Airport in Singapore is “gradually” opening service for non-Singaporean transit passengers, the Embassy is not aware of any commercial carrier that has received permission from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore to carry transit passengers to or from Changi Airport.  U.S. citizens are urged to check with their airline before attempting to transit Singapore en route to, or coming from, the United States. There may be commercial options for an immediate return to the United States from Papua New Guinea via Doha, Qatar, on Qatar Airways.  These same routes may allow transit to PNG from the United States. Transit in Brisbane en route to the United States via Qatar Airways  Multiple options are available, some of which may be subject to Australian federal or state requirements detailed below. U.S. citizens should consult a travel agent or review possible itineraries  on the websites of Air Niugini and Qatar Airways.  U.S. citizens are further advised that the Australian government recently announced that foreign nationals arriving in and departing from Australia at the same airport and who do not leave the airport do not need to obtain an exemption to Australia’s restrictions on transit and entry for non-Australian citizens and residents.  Overnight stays in Brisbane, exit from the airport, and transit times of greater than eight hours  may still require as many as three approvals prior to traveling:  A valid Australian visa or ETA if the trip or transit is greater than eight hours.  Note that processing of new ETAs is suspended.  U.S. citizens who do not currently have a valid visa or ETA are advised to apply online for a Subclass 771 (transit of less than 72 hours) or Subclass 600 (visitor) visa. An approved Queensland Travel Pass allowing the traveler to enter Queensland and exit the Brisbane airport to complete quarantine at a designated site (usually a hotel near the airport) for the duration of your transit. When applying for the Travel Pass, U.S. citizens should select the “compassionate grounds” exemption and provide the address of your intended hotel in Brisbane, recognizing that state health officials may direct you to another designated hotel. An approved exemption to Australia’s restrictions on transit and entry for non-Australian citizens and residents. U.S. citizens are advised to include in their request detailed information about their confirmed itinerary, their approved Queensland Travel Pass, as much information as possible to explain their situation as to why they are unable to complete a transit in fewer than eight hours, as well as any other information requested.  The Embassy has no authority to facilitate exemptions to Australia’s border and immigration policies and assumes no liability for delays or disruptions in travel.  Additional international commercial air services facilitating return to the United States may continue to be limited for the foreseeable future. U.S. citizens are advised that the above routes and transit options may be suspended at any time with little or no notice and are subject to Australian federal and/or state requirements or New Zealand’s requirements, as applicable.  U.S. citizens may find that online forms linked to above do not take into account their specific situation, but you should make an attempt to obtain approvals as required and with the best information available to you at the time. U.S. citizens who need to undertake domestic air or ground transportation otherwise restricted under PNG’s State of Emergency (SOE) may apply for an exemption from the SOE Controller by accessing the “Vehicle Pass” and/or “Air Travel Request” links at the PNG government’s COVID-19 website.  Approval of travel in exemption of relevant SOE orders is being decided based on strict criteria, which include emergency transport, essential services, and one-way travel for the purpose of returning to the traveler’s habitual place of residence. Due to the possibility of an extended disruption in travel options, please see the CDC’s latest recommendations for the most recent information on what you can do to reduce your risk of contracting COVID-19. Additional information, including the latest alerts and messages pertaining to Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, as well as on the latest travel restrictions, may be found on our website.

        "entry_and_exit_requirements": " NOTE:  The U.S. Department of State issued a Global Level 4 Health Advisory advising U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19. On March 19, 2020, the DFA announced the temporary suspension of visa issuance effective immediately.  The temporary suspension will deem all previously issued visas canceled, and foreigners with visas issued by Philippine Foreign Service Posts (primarily 9a Temporary Visitor/Tourist visas) will not be allowed entry into the country starting March 22, 2020.  Visas previously issued to foreign spouses and children of Filipino nationals will remain valid.  This temporary suspension has no impact on foreign nationals who are already in the country or holders of visas issued by other government agencies.  The Department of Tourism (DOT) coordinates with its Regional Offices to assist stranded foreign visitors and monitor the numbers.  Travelers may need to register with DOT, if they have not already done so.  The DOT Directory of Regional Offices can be found at: http://www.tourism.gov.ph/regional_offices.aspx.  More DOT information is located at: https://philippines.travel/safeph.  Each DOT Region also maintains a Facebook page with hotline numbers available to assist stranded foreign citizens.  Expired Philippine Visas: According to the Philippine Bureau of Immigration (BI):  Temporary visitor visa holders who have stayed in the country for less than one year may secure their Emigration Clearance Certificates (ECCs) at the international airports. BI will temporarily allow foreign nationals with approved and implemented visas who are awaiting release of their Alien Certificate of Registration Identity Card (ACR I-Card) to depart the country.  In lieu of the ACR I-Card Waiver Order, travelers will need to present the following items at the airport: passport with valid visa as indicated in the implementation stamp, official receipt of the ACR I-Card Waiver Application Fee, and ECC with Returning Permit (RP) or Special Resident Certificate (SRC), whichever is applicable.  Departing foreign nationals must retain these documents as they will be required for reentry into the Philippines under their respective visa. All applications for visa extension are suspended during the Enhanced Community Quarantine, except for outbound passengers. Foreigners whose visas will expire during the duration of the Enhanced Community Quarantine will be allowed to file an extension without fines and penalties if they file their applications within 30 days from the lifting of the Enhanced Community Quarantine. All outbound passengers with a visa that expired during the period of the Enhanced Community Quarantine will be waived fines and penalties when applying for the visa update before departing the Philippines.  The U.S. Embassy encourages U.S. citizens to monitor the Philippine Bureau of Immigration’s website for the most updated information.

The Philippine Department of Interior and Local Government also regularly posts public advisory related to community quarantine. Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put in effect with little and no advance notice. Consider your plan to shelter in place:   While the U.S. Embassy has been making every effort possible to assist U.S. citizens through coordination with local authorities including the Philippine Department of Tourism (DOT), options to fly within and out of the Philippines are extremely limited. The U.S. Embassy is exploring all options to address the current travel disruptions.

Veterans Affairs Operations:  The VA Manila Outpatient Clinic will remain closed for scheduled and walk-in health care appointments until July 2, 2020. During the last several weeks, the Clinic has made significant technological advances and been able to secure remote access to our systems for our medical providers. With these improvements, VA Manila will begin offering limited telephone appointments for Primary Care and Mental Health between May 20 and July 2, 2020.  Our doctors are reviewing their appointment lists of Veterans who had appointments that were cancelled in March and April, as well as those Veterans who have upcoming appointments for the rest of May and June scheduled. Based on their clinical review, we are contacting some Veterans to see if they would like to schedule a telephone appointment with their Primary Care Physician.   Veterans with scheduled specialty care appointments between now and July 2, 2020, those appointments have been cancelled and will need to be rescheduled. Your team scheduler will contact you when VA Manila reopens to reschedule those appointments. It is much more challenging for a specialty care provider to conduct their appointments via telephone. VA Manila is unable to add video tele-conferencing services to our telephone appointments, mostly due to the limited availability of high speed internet services outside of Metro Manila. Also, most of our specialty providers will need for you to have x-rays, lab work, or use other diagnostic equipment during your appointment that is only available in-person at VA Manila. As such, we have had to cancel all scheduled specialty appointments through July 2, 2020. This impacts the following specialty clinics:     Audiology   Gastroenterology (GI) Otolaryngology (ENT)   Cardiology  Neurology    Pulmonology      Dermatology   Ophthalmology Renal / Nephrology    Endocrinology    Orthopedics   Rheumatology      If you had a scheduled appointment in one of the above clinics between May 20 to July 2, 2020, your appointment has automatically been cancelled and VA Manila will contact you once the Clinic reopens and begins conducting face-to-face appointments again. For urgently needed specialty care, Veterans may continue to seek care from community providers and seek reimbursement of your expenses through VA’s Foreign Medical Program. Pharmacy Updates Air 21 has resumed service delivery to even more areas in the Philippines over the last ten days. Nearly all of the Philippines is now serviceable for delivery with Air 21 and LBC.  While there are still a handful of areas which remain unserved, there are very few Veterans who reside in those areas.  Below is the most recent service advisory we received from Air21 for your awareness of where they currently are accepting packages for delivery.  For areas that remain unserved by Air21 or LBC, you are advised to continue purchasing needed medications from community providers. If those medications are for a service-connected condition, you are eligible to seek reimbursement from VA’s Foreign Medical Program. Both Air21 and LBC may experience delays in shipping, and some local barangays may refuse entry to the courier companies’ drivers – in which case Veterans may need to collect their packages from the closest office. Veterans with questions about medication refills can contact the Outpatient Clinic through Secure Messenger within the MyHealtheVet online portal. Veterans can also use MyHealtheVet to request medication refills, or contact the Automated Pharmacy Refill Line at: #MyVA (#6982), Option 8 or +63-02-8550-3888, Option 8. The RAO and Embassy Fleet Post Office continue to coordinate weekly pickups of medications and other important mail for delivery to the RAOs in Subic and Angeles. FPO is continuing to look for other options for the other RAO FPO boxes and how we can get that mail to Veterans.  ",

Direct flights from Poland to the United States remain suspended until at least July 14, but there are many options for connecting flights. Travelers may book directly with airlines and address questions about travel options to transportation companies.  The Embassy is not able to assist with making travel arrangements.   Travelers are encouraged to explore the commercial options that are now available. For U.S. citizens who wish to travel to Poland: As of July 1, Poland’s border restrictions for U.S. citizens remain unchanged.  U.S. citizens who do not meet one of the existing exemptions will not be allowed to enter Poland.  A list of exemptions can be found on the U.S. Embassy’s COVID-19 page.   Enforcement of these restrictions will include random checks by the Polish Border Guard at land crossings, and travelers who attempt to circumvent Polish border restrictions may be subject to fines or other penalties. The Polish Border Guard determines who is allowed to enter Poland. The U.S. Embassy has no control over this process. If you have questions about whether your situation qualifies for an exemption or if you will be allowed to enter Poland, please contact the Border Guard by e-mail at zdsc.kg@strazgraniczna.pl or by phone at +48 22 500 40 68, +48 22 500 45 68, or +48 22 500 54 68.

For U.S. citizens who qualify for an exemption, regular, commercial flights to Poland are now available.  Travelers may book directly with airlines and address questions about travel options to transportation companies. The Presidential Proclamation of March 11, which suspends entry to the United States of persons present in the Schengen Area in the last 14 days, remains in effect.  U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents are exempt from the Proclamation and may travel to the United States from the Schengen Area, however, family members traveling on ESTA or a U.S. visa will not be able to travel to the United States from the Schengen Area (including transit through an airport in the Schengen Area), unless they meet one of the exemptions listed in the Proclamation. Due to COVID-19 related restrictions, we have limited the number of appointments for services to U.S. citizens, but appointments are available.  Appointments can be scheduled at the appointments page on our website. On July 1, the Polish Ministry of Health confirmed 34,775 cases of COVID-19 in Poland. The Ministry also reported a total of 1,477 related deaths.  U.S. citizens should reconsider travel by cruise ship to or within Asia. U.S. citizens planning travel by cruise ship elsewhere should be aware that, due to the current public health situation, many countries have implemented strict screening procedures in order to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  This is a dynamic situation and U.S. citizens traveling by ship may be impacted by travel restrictions affecting their itineraries or ability to disembark, or may be subject to quarantine procedures implemented by the local authorities.  While the U.S. government has successfully evacuated hundreds of our citizens in the previous weeks, repatriation flights should not be relied upon as an option for U.S. citizens under the potential risk of quarantine by local authorities. U.S. citizens should evaluate the risks associated with choosing to remain in an area that may be subject to quarantine and take the appropriate proactive measures. Passengers who plan to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line companies directly for further information on the current rules and restrictions, and continue to monitor the Travel.state.gov website for updated information.

General Conditions, Entry, and Exit: The country is currently under a State of Emergency (SOE), during which national and provincial governments have enacted various measures to prevent the importation and spread of COVID-19.  You may find more information about the country’s COVID-19 response and about measures put in place at https://covid19.info.gov.pg/. All inbound passengers must have an appropriate visa or entry permit and must also secure explicit approval from, and follow all instructions provided by, the SOE Controller.  U.S. citizens who wish to enter the country should complete the atwrite to covid19-admin.logistics@police.gov.pg to request instructions and approval, as appropriate.  All approved incoming passengers also need to complete an Air Passenger Travel Form to present to the airline at the time of check in. Air Niugini is currently the only airline operating international service to and from PNG.  It continues to operate a reduced schedule of international flights for inbound and outbound passengers between Port Moresby and Brisbane and Cairns, Australia, though there are few viable options for onward international travel to the United States. Air Niugini also operates regular flights to and from Singapore.  However, despite media reports that the Changi Airport in Singapore is “gradually” opening service for non-Singaporean transit passengers, the Embassy is not aware of any commercial carrier that has received permission from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore to carry transit passengers to or from Changi Airport.  U.S. citizens are urged to check with their airline before attempting to transit Singapore en route to, or coming from, the United States. There may be commercial options for an immediate return to the United States from Papua New Guinea via Doha, Qatar, on Qatar Airways.  These same routes may allow transit to PNG from the United States. Transit in Brisbane en route to the United States via Qatar Airways  Multiple options are available, some of which may be subject to Australian federal or state requirements detailed below. U.S. citizens should consult a travel agent or review possible itineraries  on the websites of Air Niugini and Qatar Airways.  U.S. citizens are further advised that the Australian government recently announced that foreign nationals arriving in and departing from Australia at the same airport and who do not leave the airport do not need to obtain an exemption to Australia’s restrictions on transit and entry for non-Australian citizens and residents.  Overnight stays in Brisbane, exit from the airport, and transit times of greater than eight hours  may still require as many as three approvals prior to traveling:  A valid Australian visa or ETA if the trip or transit is greater than eight hours.  Note that processing of new ETAs is suspended.  U.S. citizens who do not currently have a valid visa or ETA are advised to apply online for a Subclass 771 (transit of less than 72 hours) or Subclass 600 (visitor) visa. An approved Queensland Travel Pass allowing the traveler to enter Queensland and exit the Brisbane airport to complete quarantine at a designated site (usually a hotel near the airport) for the duration of your transit. When applying for the Travel Pass, U.S. citizens should select the “compassionate grounds” exemption and provide the address of your intended hotel in Brisbane, recognizing that state health officials may direct you to another designated hotel. An approved exemption to Australia’s restrictions on transit and entry for non-Australian citizens and residents. U.S. citizens are advised to include in their request detailed information about their confirmed itinerary, their approved Queensland Travel Pass, as much information as possible to explain their situation as to why they are unable to complete a transit in fewer than eight hours, as well as any other information requested.  The Embassy has no authority to facilitate exemptions to Australia’s border and immigration policies and assumes no liability for delays or disruptions in travel.  Additional international commercial air services facilitating return to the United States may continue to be limited for the foreseeable future. U.S. citizens are advised that the above routes and transit options may be suspended at any time with little or no notice and are subject to Australian federal and/or state requirements or New Zealand’s requirements, as applicable.  U.S. citizens may find that online forms linked to above do not take into account their specific situation, but you should make an attempt to obtain approvals as required and with the best information available to you at the time. U.S. citizens who need to undertake domestic air or ground transportation otherwise restricted under PNG’s State of Emergency (SOE) may apply for an exemption from the SOE Controller by accessing the “Vehicle Pass” and/or “Air Travel Request” links at the PNG government’s COVID-19 website.  Approval of travel in exemption of relevant SOE orders is being decided based on strict criteria, which include emergency transport, essential services, and one-way travel for the purpose of returning to the traveler’s habitual place of residence.

        "country_specific_information": "  The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced a plan to provide free face masks to foreigners in South Korea. Beginning April 6, U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals can show a passport or alien registration card and receive masks and filters at eight metropolitan locations: Seoul Global Center, Southwest Seoul Global Center, Seongdong Global Migrant Center, Seongbuk Global Migrant Center, Eunpyeong Global Migrant Center, Yangcheon Global Migrant Center, Geumcheon Global Migrant Center and Gangdong Global Migrant Center. The Republic of Korea (ROK) has confirmed cases of COVID-19 within its borders. Authorities have confirmed that community-based transmission is occurring in Korea. The U.S. Embassy in Seoul continues to closely monitor developments related to COVID-19 in the ROK. The U.S. Department of State currently has a level 3 travel advisory (Reconsider Travel) for the ROK and level 4 (Do Not Travel) for Daegu specifically. Please see the full language of the travel advisory here. Certain airlines have reduced or suspended flights to the ROK, we suggest that you check with your individual airline for any changes to your itinerary. Despite this reduction in flight services by several carriers, South Korea remains well-served by commercial aviation; the Embassy recommends that U.S. citizens who wish to depart do so via commercial air. Please see https://www.airport.kr/ap/en/index.do to check departure schedules and flight availability.  ",
        "entry_and_exit_requirements": " June 1, 2020: Foreigners who are long term residents of the Republic of Korea (ROK) will be required to obtain a re-entry permit prior to departing for international travel. The permits are available at immigration offices, airports, and port offices. The cost is 30,000 won and the re-entry permit is valid for one year. Failure to apply for a re-entry permit prior to departure will result in the cancellation of the traveler’s ROK Alien Registration.  Foreign long-term residents of the ROK will also be required to provide a medical certificate or negative COVID-19 test before boarding flights to Korea.  The certificate must be in English or Korean and signed by a medical professional within 48 hours of departure; it should include information about fever, cough, and other potential symptoms.  While a negative COVID-19 test result is accepted for immigration, it is not a requirement for the medical certificate.  Diplomats (A-1), Government Officials (A-2, A-3) or Overseas Korean (F-4) status do not need to apply for re-entry permits or provide medical certificates when returning to Korea. IMPORTANT UPDATE FOR U.S. TRAVELERS TO SOUTH KOREA: Effective as of April 1st, the Republic of Korea’s Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for ALL inbound passengers.  Most foreign travelers on short-term travel will be required to quarantine at a government-designated facility at their own expense for 14 days (this includes U.S. citizens traveling on 90-day visa free travel and short-term visa holders).  The nightly cost at these facilities could range from $100 to $150 USD per night (approximately $1,400-$2,100 USD total), depending on various factors and prices are set by the Korean authorities.  Passengers that fall into this category will be required to sign a release form from the ROK agreeing to these conditions prior to boarding the plane.  If the passenger refuses to sign the form, they will be denied boarding. Details about the quarantine process and a copy of the release form are available on the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in the USA website. Travelers who are long-term or residential will be required to self-quarantine at their own residences. All passengers who exhibit symptoms will be required to undergo COVID-19 testing on arrival at the airport and may be subject to additional procedures. Some U.S. citizens traveling to South Korea for diplomatic, business, humanitarian, or, academic reasons may be exempt from self-quarantine requirements but will require pre-approved waiver from a Korean Embassy or Consulate in the United States prior to traveling. Korean health authorities have indicated that all passengers will be required to download and respond to daily questions via a Self-Diagnosis Mobile App for 14 days. Those who violate the self-quarantine order may be subject to a fine, arrest, or deportation.  Passengers who are unable to download the mobile app must provide a valid phone number and address in Korea to facilitate daily health monitoring by local government officials.  Passengers transiting through Incheon International Airport to third countries will not face the new quarantine requirement, but will receive a temperature screening and health questionnaire. As the State Department has already advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19, please take these new screening procedures into account before you decide to continue with your travel plans to the Republic of Korea.  All travelers to Korea should be aware that COVID-19 screening measures are subject to change with little advance notice.  For the latest information, please refer to Incheon International Airport and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of 12:00 a.m. on March 3 the ROK began temperature screening all passengers on direct flights from the ROK to the United States. This mandatory screening applies to all passengers on U.S.-bound flights. Passengers who exceed the temperature restriction will not be permitted to board, and their baggage will be removed from the aircraft.  Health screening procedures are subject to change at any time and your individual airline has the authority to deny boarding at their discretion based on your individual circumstances. We recommend that you check with your airline prior to travel in order to confirm current procedures. The Korean Ministry of Justice has published emergency measures to counter the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, the following will be restricted entry into South Korea:  Those travelers with passports issued in Hubei, China. Korean visas to travelers who were issued in Hubei Province, China will be cancelled. All foreign nationals who visited Hubei Province, China in the past 14 days will be restricted entry.

Sweden, like other Nordic countries, follows guidelines and recommendations from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).  Quarantine in its compulsory form is considered an extreme measure, which is strictly regulated by the Infection Protection Act and is not currently considered justified. In Sweden, most preventative measures don’t involve involuntary quarantine.  Instead, individuals are expected to act responsibly and follow the given recommendations, including immediately seeking out medical assistance if signs of infection appear.  If the recommendations are not adhered to, a designated physician in the relevant medical region can decide on mandatory quarantine or isolation.  ",

Sources of data related to the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths may be incomplete, but Tajikistan is experiencing widespread community transmission.  Acting WHO Representative Bahtygul Karriyeva told reporters on June 6 that the pandemic has not yet hit its peak in Tajikistan. The Tajik government has announced its intention to re-open, by June 15, various state institutions and private businesses, restaurants, and salons that had previously been closed due to COVID-19.  Reopening businesses could lead to a new spike in COVID-19 cases. Access to medical care Tajik hospitals and clinics may be limited. Medical evacuation, even for those who are insured, may not be possible due to the lack of commercial flights in and out of Tajikistan. U.S. citizens should consider avoiding public places that are likely to be crowded and should review the CDC guidelines for social distancing.   The Tajik government has introduced new, mandatory requirements for the use of masks in public, including while inside a vehicle.  Failure to wear a facial mask in public or in a vehicle may be subject to a fine. Reconsider travel to Tajikistan due to the Global Health Advisory and measures, including severe travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, implemented by the Government of Tajikistan in response to COVID-19.  Entry and Exit Document Requirements:  The Dushanbe International Airport is currently closed. It is not known when the airport will reopen.  Despite media reports that Turkish Airlines and other commercial carriers are interested in re-establishing commercial routes with Tajikistan, the Tajik Ministry of Aviation has not announced a timetable for reopening the airport. Tajikistan is currently restricting Tajik nationals and foreigners, including U.S. citizens, from leaving the country. Until travel restrictions are lifted, U.S. citizens planning to depart Tajikistan on a chartered flight should contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance on getting permission to depart the country. The Government of Tajikistan has extended the validity of all visa categories to July 1.  U.S. citizens interested in leaving Tajikistan once commercial flights are resumed should ensure that their Tajik visa is still valid prior to booking travel.  U.S. citizens should contact the Main Consular Department at 227-6363 located on 34 Pushkin Street, Dushanbe to extend visas as necessary.   The Government of Tajikistan frequently adjusts its entry and exit requirements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes to policy are not immediately made available to the public.

If you arrive on an international flight, you should expect to spend 14 to 21 days under government quarantine at Hotel Lebene in Lome.  The U.S. Embassy in Lome will not intervene in your government-mandated quarantine unless the quarantine exceeds 21 days and you have had no positive COVID-19 nasal swab test result during that time. However, no passengers, including those with dual citizenship or a Togolese residency permit or national ID arriving on international flights, including from Addis Ababa, Newark, and Houston, are currently allowed entry in Togo.

General Conditions, Entry, and Exit: The country is currently under a State of Emergency (SOE), during which national and provincial governments have enacted various measures to prevent the importation and spread of COVID-19.  You may find more information about the country’s COVID-19 response and about measures put in place at https://covid19.info.gov.pg/. All inbound passengers must have an appropriate visa or entry permit and must also secure explicit approval from, and follow all instructions provided by, the SOE Controller.  U.S. citizens who wish to enter the country should complete the atwrite to covid19-admin.logistics@police.gov.pg to request instructions and approval, as appropriate.  All approved incoming passengers also need to complete an Air Passenger Travel Form to present to the airline at the time of check in. Air Niugini is currently the only airline operating international service to and from PNG.  It continues to operate a reduced schedule of international flights for inbound and outbound passengers between Port Moresby and Brisbane and Cairns, Australia, though there are few viable options for onward international travel to the United States. Air Niugini also operates regular flights to and from Singapore.  However, despite media reports that the Changi Airport in Singapore is “gradually” opening service for non-Singaporean transit passengers, the Embassy is not aware of any commercial carrier that has received permission from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore to carry transit passengers to or from Changi Airport.  U.S. citizens are urged to check with their airline before attempting to transit Singapore en route to, or coming from, the United States. There may be commercial options for an immediate return to the United States from Papua New Guinea via Doha, Qatar, on Qatar Airways.  These same routes may allow transit to PNG from the United States. Transit in Brisbane en route to the United States via Qatar Airways  Multiple options are available, some of which may be subject to Australian federal or state requirements detailed below. U.S. citizens should consult a travel agent or review possible itineraries  on the websites of Air Niugini and Qatar Airways.  U.S. citizens are further advised that the Australian government recently announced that foreign nationals arriving in and departing from Australia at the same airport and who do not leave the airport do not need to obtain an exemption to Australia’s restrictions on transit and entry for non-Australian citizens and residents.  Overnight stays in Brisbane, exit from the airport, and transit times of greater than eight hours  may still require as many as three approvals prior to traveling:  A valid Australian visa or ETA if the trip or transit is greater than eight hours.  Note that processing of new ETAs is suspended.  U.S. citizens who do not currently have a valid visa or ETA are advised to apply online for a Subclass 771 (transit of less than 72 hours) or Subclass 600 (visitor) visa. An approved Queensland Travel Pass allowing the traveler to enter Queensland and exit the Brisbane airport to complete quarantine at a designated site (usually a hotel near the airport) for the duration of your transit. When applying for the Travel Pass, U.S. citizens should select the “compassionate grounds” exemption and provide the address of your intended hotel in Brisbane, recognizing that state health officials may direct you to another designated hotel. An approved exemption to Australia’s restrictions on transit and entry for non-Australian citizens and residents. U.S. citizens are advised to include in their request detailed information about their confirmed itinerary, their approved Queensland Travel Pass, as much information as possible to explain their situation as to why they are unable to complete a transit in fewer than eight hours, as well as any other information requested.  The Embassy has no authority to facilitate exemptions to Australia’s border and immigration policies and assumes no liability for delays or disruptions in travel.  Additional international commercial air services facilitating return to the United States may continue to be limited for the foreseeable future. U.S. citizens are advised that the above routes and transit options may be suspended at any time with little or no notice and are subject to Australian federal and/or state requirements or New Zealand’s requirements, as applicable.  U.S. citizens may find that online forms linked to above do not take into account their specific situation, but you should make an attempt to obtain approvals as required and with the best information available to you at the time. U.S. citizens who need to undertake domestic air or ground transportation otherwise restricted under PNG’s State of Emergency (SOE) may apply for an exemption from the SOE Controller by accessing the “Vehicle Pass” and/or “Air Travel Request” links at the PNG government’s COVID-19 website.  Approval of travel in exemption of relevant SOE orders is being decided based on strict criteria, which include emergency transport, essential services, and one-way travel for the purpose of returning to the traveler’s habitual place of residence. Due to the possibility of an extended disruption in travel options, please see the CDC’s latest recommendations for the most recent information on what you can do to reduce your risk of contracting COVID-19. Additional information, including the latest alerts and messages pertaining to Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, as well as on the latest travel restrictions, may be found on our website. Travelers should, however, be prepared for additional travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. ",

        "quarantine_inforamation": " * Vietnam currently provides an automatic extension of temporary stay through July 31, 2020, for foreigners who entered Vietnam with a visa exemption certificate, e-visa, or tourist visa on or after March 1, 2020, and intend to depart Vietnam during the period of extension.  Individuals in this qualifying group may exit Vietnam during this period without having to apply for an extension of stay. The U.S. Embassy Hanoi and Consulate General Ho Chi Minh City may issue exit letters in support of U.S. citizens who entered Vietnam before March 1, 2020, and can present concrete plans to exit Vietnam by July 31.  However, the Embassy and Consulate can in no way sponsor U.S. citizens during their stay in Vietnam.  U.S. citizens may request an exit letter here. * All schools and businesses in Vietnam have reopened.  * The U.S. Embassy in Hanoi and Consulate General Ho Chi Minh City have resumed routine processing of passports and Consular Reports of Birth Abroad (CRBA). U.S. passport printing centers have also resumed limited operations and are processing the backlog of cases on a first-in, first-out basis. We do not yet know exact delivery times for new passports, but we will update this information on our website when delivery times return to normal. * U.S. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo urged U.S. citizens interested in returning to the United States during the outbreak of COVID-19 to make immediate use of available commercial flight options, as the number of locations in need of assistance around the world may not allow for a charter option.  For those wishing to depart Vietnam, international flights are presently very limited. Additional information regarding flights departing Vietnam can be found here. * The U.S. Embassy and Consulate cannot intervene in the quarantine rules established by the Vietnamese government, and may not issue any documentation requesting the Vietnamese government to waive the quarantine requirements for U.S. citizens.  Please also note that the Vietnamese government has imposed strict penalties on violations.  For further details, please see “Question: What can you do for me if I’m forced into quarantine?” on our Frequently-Asked-Questions page here. * The U.S. Department of State’s Global Level 4 Health Advisory applies to, and includes, Vietnam. On March 19, the Department of State implemented a Global Level 4 Health Advisory advising U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel due to the global impact of COVID-19. * Any travelers experiencing symptoms of the COVID-19 virus — fever, cough and difficulty breathing — or those concerned they may have been exposed to the virus should call Vietnam’s health hotline right away: 19003228 (Vietnamese language only – if necessary, please try to have a Vietnamese speaker help connect you with the operator of this hotline). Country-Specific Information for Vietnam: * According to the Vietnamese Ministry of Health, Vietnam has had 355 confirmed cases of COVID-19 within its borders since the virus first became known.  336 people have recovered and were released from the hospital. 19 cases are being isolated for treatment.  It has been 77 days without any cases of community transmission in Vietnam; the most recent 88 confirmed cases are all people who arrived in Vietnam with COVID-19 and (like all arrivals) were sent immediately to centralized quarantine.  For further details please see the Vietnamese Ministry of Health website here. * All people in Vietnam are encouraged to wear face masks and avoid close contact with others in public places if possible.  All travelers on domestic and international flights must wear face masks during the flight and while at the airport. * Domestic airline and railway transportation has been allowed to ease restrictions.  More daily flights and trains within Vietnam are now available.  Please visit their websites or contact your ticketing agencies if you have further questions. Entry and Exit Requirements: * The Government of Vietnam has not lifted the suspension of entry for foreigners, including people with a Vietnamese visa exemption certificate.  Vietnamese authorities have not announced a potential date to allow foreigners to enter Vietnam again.  This policy, which went into effect on March 22, has limited exemptions for diplomatic, official duty, and special cases, including experts, business managers, high-tech workers, and other essential categories as determined by the Government of Vietnam.  U.S. citizens may read the original announcement here.  Additional health restrictions still apply for any foreign travelers in an exempted category allowed to enter Vietnam by local immigration authorities, including a mandatory two-week quarantine period and potential COVID-19 testing.  U.S. Embassy Hanoi and Consulate General Ho Chi Minh City remind U.S. citizens that the U.S. Department of State’s Global 4 Health Advisory still applies, and U.S. citizens are advised to avoid all international travel unless absolutely necessary. * The Vietnamese government recommends that all persons who have entered Vietnam (including Vietnamese citizens and foreigners) from March 1 until the present should: 1) Complete the medical declaration form here; 2) Implement 14-day self-quarantine at home (if not yet subject to concentrated quarantine) and limit contact with others after the 14-day period; 3) Wear face masks, wash hands with soap or antiseptic alcohol, and take other preventive measures; and 4) Contact the nearest health facility for advice and support. * Health declaration is mandatory for all passengers entering Vietnam, which can be done by completing a paper form on arrival or a digital form online before the trip here.  Travelers should contact their airlines directly for information. Quarantine Information in Vietnam: * The Government of Vietnam began a COVID-19 testing campaign for all people who have arrived from outside the country since March 8, 2020.  The U.S. Embassy and Consulate advise U.S. citizens to comply with testing.  Seek medical care right away if you believe you may have COVID-19 (or similar symptoms) or were exposed to someone who may have COVID-19 in the last six weeks. * Travelers entering Vietnam, including Vietnamese nationals, have been subjected to mandatory, centralized quarantine for 14 days. This quarantine requirement has in some cases been prolonged to more than 14 days when deemed necessary by the authorities.  Quarantine sites in Vietnam may be uncomfortable and may have only rudimentary facilities. * The U.S. Embassy and Consulate cannot intervene in the quarantine rules established by the Vietnamese government, and may not issue any documentation requesting the Vietnamese government to waive the quarantine requirements for U.S. citizens.
